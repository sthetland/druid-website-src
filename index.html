          <h5>A fast, modern analytics database</h5>
          <p>
            Druid is designed for <a href='/use-cases'>workflows</a> where fast ad-hoc analytics, instant data visibility, or supporting high concurrency is important. As such, Druid is often used to power UIs where an interactive, consistent user experience is desired.

          <h5>Easy integration with your existing data pipelines</h5>
          <p>
            Druid streams data from message buses such as <a href='http://kafka.apache.org/'>Kafka</a>, and <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/'>Amazon Kinesis</a>, and batch load files from data lakes such as <a href='https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html'>HDFS</a>, and <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>Amazon S3</a>. Druid supports most popular file formats for structured and semi-structured data.

          <h5>Fast, consistent queries at high concurrency</h5>
          <p>
            Druid has been <a href='https://imply.io/post/performance-benchmark-druid-presto-hive'>benchmarked</a> to greatly outperform legacy solutions. Druid combines novel storage ideas, indexing structures, and both exact and approximate queries to return most results in under a second.

          <p>
            Druid <a href='/use-cases'>unlocks new types of queries and workflows</a> for clickstream, APM, supply chain, network telemetry, digital marketing, risk/fraud, and many other types of data. Druid is purpose built for rapid, ad-hoc queries on both real-time and historical data.
